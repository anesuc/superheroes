<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Superheroes Explorer][homepage.png]](http://superheroes.veel.tv:3000/)

It is obviously easier and more convinient to use the live hosted version of this. However, if you want to run it your self locally, you can find instructions on how to do that below.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. Another imprtant note to coonsider is that this has been mostly tested in Chrome. There could be some issues with other browsers I am not aware of.

### Prerequisites

* node v12.0.0+ (this will depend on your platform for how to install it).
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
  * Yarn (this will depend on your platform for how to install it).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anesuc/superheroes.git
   ```
2. Go into the project diretory:
   ```sh
   cd superheroes
   ```
3. Install nodemon globally and the server dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm i nodemon -g
   yarn
3. Finally run it with:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```



## Usage

Search in the search box for any superhero character you are interested in. It will show you suggestions as you do so as seen below:
[![Superheroes explorer search][search-superhero-view.png]]

Once you find the character you are interested in, press enter or select it from the suggestion. You will then be met with the info screen as seen below:

Alternatively, you can select previously saved superheroes to get to the same page.

You can edit statistics of a superhero by selecting the blue edit button as seen below:
